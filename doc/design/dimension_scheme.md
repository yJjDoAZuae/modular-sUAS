# The dimension scheme

*IP-FC-36. Written 2026-08-21.*

Which dimensions a generated drawing carries, and how to know the set is complete.

[OQ-ARCH-7](../architecture/freecad_migration.md#open-questions) decided the shape of this on
2026-08-07: **dimension the interfaces first, grow into a full parameter-driven scheme second.**
It named one prerequisite — *"agreement on what belongs to the interface"* — and assigned it to
`doc/architecture/overview.md`, which does not exist. This document supplies that agreement
from the design authorities that do exist, so the prerequisite is met by enumeration rather
than by waiting.

## 1. The membership test

A part has hundreds of dimensionable edges and a useful drawing carries a dozen. The question
is not "which are interesting" — that is taste, and taste does not scale to 576 variants.

> **A dimension belongs to the interface set if and only if another part's geometry depends
> on it.**

That is mechanical, not aesthetic. It also has a convenient property in this project:
**the clearance parameters already enumerate the joints.** Every entry in
`design_constants.json`'s `tolerances` group exists because two parts meet somewhere, and its
`why` names the joint and gives the expression. There are seven, and there are seven joints.

The register below is therefore not a new list to be maintained beside the code — it is a
reading of a file the sweep already validates on every run.

## 2. The interface register

`U` is the size multiplier, `w` is `extrusion_width`, `n_p` is `cowl_n_perimeters`.

| # | Joint | Governing expression | Clearance | Carried by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | longeron tube → corner bore | bore radius = `longeron_radius + longeron_tolerance`; lead-in chamfer = `w` | `longeron_tolerance` 0.05 | corner |
| 2 | bulkhead greeble post → corner socket | socket opened out by the clearance; **post stays nominal** | `greeble_tolerance` 0.05 | corner |
| 3 | corner seating faces → bulkhead | `flat_x += corner_tolerance`, `flat_offset += corner_tolerance·√2` | `corner_tolerance` 0.0 | corner |
| 4 | panel → corner | slot `2·panel_thickness + 2·panel_tolerance` deep, outer face at `corner_radius − panel_thickness − panel_tolerance`; extension `panel_overlap + panel_offset − panel_tolerance` | `panel_tolerance` 0.1 | corner |
| 5 | panel → bulkhead flange | standoff so the panel's outer surface lands on the mold line at `corner_radius` | `panel_tolerance` 0.1 | bulkhead |
| 6 | boom tube → boom bulkhead collet | `collet_radius = boom_diameter/2 + boom_collet_thickness + boom_tolerance` | `boom_tolerance` 0.2 | bulkhead |
| 7 | cowl → cowling bulkhead flange | flange outer radius = `corner_radius − n_p·w − cowl_flange_tolerance`; flange height `2·U` | `cowl_flange_tolerance` 0.2 | bulkhead |
| 8 | nose closure → cowl shell | base offset = `n_p·w + nose_flange_tolerance` | `nose_flange_tolerance` −0.1 | nose closure |
| 9 | nose plate → nose closure | pocket radius = `plate_diam/2 + plate_tol`, relieved at `overhang_angle_from_bed` | `plate.tolerance` 0.1 | nose closure |
| 10 | bolt or insert → bulkhead | `bolt_offset = 8·U` on the diagonal; `bolt_radius` = `diameter/2`, or the insert bore from [`threaded_insert_dimensions.csv`](../../src/Fuselage/tools/threaded_insert_dimensions.csv) | — | bulkhead |

### Three things the drawing has to say that a dimension alone does not

**Which part carries the clearance.** Joints 2 and 3 are both carried *entirely on the corner*
— the bulkhead re-evaluates the same shape and passes 0, so the joint takes the clearance once.
A drawing that dimensions both sides at nominal is not wrong about either part and is wrong
about the joint. An inspector measuring the bulkhead's post against a drawing that showed a
clearance would reject a good part.

**Which zeros are structural.** `panel_tolerance` is 0 on a cowling bulkhead and on the 0 mm
panel variants; `cowl_flange_tolerance` is 0 on every non-cowling type; `plate.tolerance` is 0
on `tail_high_open`, where the plate is inactive. **These are not settings at their minimum —
they are the absence of the joint.** A generated drawing must omit the dimension, not print
`0.0`, because a dimensioned zero asserts a coincident fit that was designed and inspectable,
and here there is nothing to inspect.

**Which constraint governs, when more than one can.** The corner's flat face is

```
flat_offset = -max(longeron_radius + longeron_tolerance + longeron_chamfer,
                   (panel_overlap + panel_offset) - (corner_radius - panel_thickness - panel_tolerance))
```

— a two-sided constraint. The face must clear the longeron bore *and* sit outside wherever the
panel interface has been pushed to, and **whichever binds, wins**. Which one binds changes
across the family. OQ-ARCH-7 chose a family drawing with a per-variant value table, so the
table carries the number; the note has to carry *which term produced it*, or a reader takes the
wrong design intent away from a correct number.

## 3. The completeness test

> **The set is complete when, for every entry in `design_constants.json`'s `tolerances` group,
> the drawing carries every dimension that entry's expression consumes.**

Mechanical, and checkable against a file that already exists and is already validated —
`load_constants()` refuses a missing name and refuses an unrecognized one, so the group cannot
silently drift out from under the test.

Worked: joint 7's expression consumes `corner_radius`, `n_p`, `w` and `cowl_flange_tolerance`.
The drawing carries the resulting flange radius and the clearance. `n_p·w` is the radial room
the **cowl's** wall occupies, so a drawing of the *bulkhead* that dimensions the flange without
saying what the subtraction is for leaves its most important number unexplained — the reason
the flange is where it is lives in another part.

**Three known gaps in the test, stated rather than left to be discovered.**

1. **Joint 9's clearance is not in the group.** `plate.tolerance` lives in the per-cowl-type
   parameter files. That is defensible and follows the structural-zero pattern — it is 0.1 on
   `nose_round_plate` and 0 on `tail_high_open`, where there is no plate — but it means the
   test must read the cowl type files too, not only `design_constants.json`.
2. **Joint 10 has no clearance parameter at all.** A bolt through a hole and a heat-set insert
   in a bore are different fits, and neither is named. The insert bore comes from
   `threaded_insert_dimensions.csv`, which is the authority for insert geometry and must not be
   re-derived; the bolt clearance is not written down anywhere.
3. **`corner_tolerance` is 0 and its own note flags why that may be wrong.** [OQ-DES-C5](corner.md#open-questions)
   resolved on 2026-08-14 by creating the parameter and holding it at 0, which is what every
   flown part was built at. The entry records the residual plainly: *"if these faces are bonded,
   0 leaves no bond line."* That is the same question [OQ-DES-CW10](cowl.md#open-questions)
   answered for the nose base joint on 2026-08-21, and it is unanswered here. **A drawing
   generated today will dimension a zero-clearance fit that may be a bonded joint.**

## 4. Internal structure is reference geometry

OQ-ARCH-7 chose alternative 3 first: **dimension the interfaces, show internal structure as
non-dimensioned reference geometry.** Nothing in this document reopens that.

The reasoning is worth restating because it is easy to read as a shortcut and it is not one.
Internal structure here — webs, fillets, greeble nubs, buttress ramps — is **derived**, not
chosen. `web.fillet_radius` is `2·U`, `bulkhead_flange.chamfer` is `1·U`,
`plate.thickness` is `ceil(4·U)·layer_height`. Dimensioning a derived quantity on a drawing
duplicates a formula that already exists in one place, and a duplicate that can disagree is
worse than an absence. The variant table carries the value; the formula stays in
`derived_parameters()`.

**What promotes an internal dimension to the interface set** is the membership test in §1 and
nothing else: another part's geometry coming to depend on it. That is not hypothetical —
`n_p·w` began as a property of the cowl's wall and now sets the *bulkhead's* flange radius
(joint 7), and the same count reaches the nose closure's base offset (joint 8). When that
happens the dimension moves into the register and the drawing gains it.

## 5. Scope

This document owns the enumeration and the test. It does not own drawing layout, sheet size,
projection convention, or standards compliance, none of which are decided.

**It is a placeholder for a section of a document that does not exist.** OQ-ARCH-7 assigns
interface conventions to `doc/architecture/overview.md`. When that is written, §1 and §2 belong
in its interface-conventions section, and what remains here is the drawing-specific part: §3's
test and §4's reference-geometry rule.
